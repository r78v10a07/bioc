The BioC is a C library for Bioinformatics tools.

Nowadays, working with “mountains” of data is a common task on Bioinformatics. Frequently, high level programming languages like Perl, Python or even Java are not fast enough to process data efficiently. In this case, low level languages as C can be the difference between 5 days and a few hours of processing. Prototypes programs can be easily developed with high level languages just as a proof of concept. However, optimized code, in low level languages, are needed to get down this “mountains” of data.

Basic modules:

  * [berror Error]
  * [bmemory Memory]
  * [btime Time]
  * [bstring String]
  * [btree Btree]

Bioinformatics modules

  * [fasta Fasta]
  * [taxonomy Taxonomy]

Associated to the library there are some applications:

  * [BuildBtreeIndexFasta Build a binary index file for a fasta file]
  * [SplitFastaFile Split a fasta file by overlapped reads]
  * [TaxLienageFromGi Print the taxonomy lineage from GenBank Gi]
  * [TaxLienageFromTaxId Print the taxonomy lineage from TaxId]
  * [TaxonerAssamblerMarkerDB An basic assembler program for the Taxoner output using overlaped reads]
