The BioC library includes basic functions written in C for Bioinformatics tools.

Basic modules:

  * [berror Error]
  * [bmemory Memory]
  * [btime Time]
  * [bstring String]
  * [btree Btree]

Bioinformatics modules

  * [fasta Fasta]
  * [taxonomy Taxonomy]

Associated to the library there are some applications:

  * [BuildBtreeIndexFasta Build a binary index file for a fasta file]
  * [SplitFastaFile Split a fasta file by overlapped reads]
  * [TaxLienageFromGi Print the taxonomy lineage from GenBank Gi]
  * [TaxLienageFromTaxId Print the taxonomy lineage from TaxId]
  * [TaxonerAssamblerMarkerDB An basic assembler program for the Taxoner output using overlaped reads]
